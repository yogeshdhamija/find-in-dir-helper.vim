`find-in-dir-helper.vim` lets you find text in a directory more easily.

                                            *\f*
This is default mapping provided by `find-in-dir-helper.vim` (see: |find-in-dir-helper.txt|).
It's triggered in `normal` and `visual` modes.
If this is remapped in your vim configuration, that will take precedence. You 
can then remap |<Plug>FindSelectedTextInDir| and |<Plug>FindInDirHelper| per
your preference to take advantage of this plugin.

                                            *<Plug>FindInDirHelper*
Can be triggered in normal mode to find text within a directory.
Simply trigger, type your search, and press enter.

The default mapping is |\f|, but can be changed through (for example):
>
    nmap F <Plug>FindInDirHelper
<
It will use |grepprg| to search |pwd| and populate the results in a |location-list|.
The exact underlying commands being used will be displayed.

                                            *<Plug>FindSelectedTextInDir*
Can be triggered in visual mode to find the selected text within a directory.
Simply trigger and press enter.

The default mapping is |\f|, but can be changed through (for example):
>
    xmap F <Plug>FindSelectedTextInDir
<
It will use |grepprg| to search |pwd| and populate the results in your |location-list|.
The exact underlying commands being used will be displayed.
